_This blog post is part of the [Agora Road Travelogue for July 2024](https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php?threads/agora-road-travelogue-july-24.6868/)_

Just a couple of years back, hispachan.org shut down forever. Hispachan was a Spanish-speaking image board, akin
to what 4chan is in the English-speaking Internet. Just like Spanish Wikipedia, the fewer number of moderators
compared to that of their English counterpart made the overall experience a lot wilder. So, while in 4chan it was
rare to engage in constructive discussion, in Hispachan it was downright impossible. And still, Hispachan was the
website in which I spent most of my time during lockdown, back in 2020 and all the way until its closure in 2022.
The main aspect that dragged me back there was what I call “tercermundismo”, or _third-worldism_, situations
that can only occur in a country in which people are used to constant human rights violations and lack of trust in
social institutions, where some sort of organized wild-west mentality predominates and people have to live their
day-to-day lives using a mix of wit and cynicism. The emotions that emerge from the exposure to these experiences
range from hilarity to downright admiration.

As such, I felt right at home when browsing Hispachan. I did even post in there; I was an active member of that
community. Not that I was any less toxic than the other users. There was some sort of curse that fell upon us that
urged us to behave like savages, to fall victim of our instincts. As a consequence, the emotions that predominated
the minds and souls of us, Hispachan users, were mostly those of rage and lust. So when I first heard that the
site was going to close down, the main thing I felt was liberation, the notion that I no longer had to engage in
the vicious cycle of reading other people's enticing, rage-inducing, comments or, as they are known in the image
board space, _baits_; there was no longer a sea in which I could fall prey to them.

However, with Hispachan now closed I was left without an Internet place to call home. I then started to look for
any other place that could satisfy my Internet browsing needs. I wandered around other Spanish speaking image
boards, Facebook groups and ended up in a place called Agora Road, a web forum that appeals to nostalgia holders
and schizo-posters in equal parts. Yet I wasn't unaffected by Hispachan's overall toxicity. I could even say that
I was scarred for life by it. In any place I visited I could feel the threatening aura of those terminally online,
and could feel reminiscences of my time in the darkest places on the web. I, an image board veteran, had had my
fair share of nightmare inducing content, some of which I can still remember to this day and that I have had a
hard time trying to forget.

All of this led me to wonder if there was any place left on the Internet where one could safely browse, whatever
that means. Hey, maybe I just became too sensitive akin to those social justice warriors that see offensive
content anywhere and that I dreaded so much back then. But honestly, and a lot of my peers in the Agora Road seem
to agree, the Internet has simply became much worse lately. It seems that the innocence that once was the norm is
now but a forgotten relic of the past. I particularly want to blame the notion of “content”. Every piece of
communication shared on the Internet has now become content, that is, material that can be shared across multiple
platforms and can return in exchange money or Internet fame. One of the web platforms where this phenomenon is the
most notorious is in Reddit, the _infant terrible_ of the Internet for _normies,_ or Internet casuals,
and just another cringe website for terminally online peers. Reddit is the perfect example on what happens when
you start paying, even if via a virtual currency, your “content creators”: everything becomes cynical, everything
lacks authenticity, everything reads like a lie prefabricated to generate engagement. About that I can only quote
[what the blog _Fuck You, Tiger_ says about Julio Cortázar's short stories](http://fuckyoutiger.blogspot.com/2004/10/):
“Hasta en los mejores cuentos de Cortázar uno puede ‘verlo' tendiendo los hilos, armando las trampas, calibrando
la impresión crítica…”<a className="sdfootnoteanc" id="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a>
This lack of genuineness makes the overall experience of the web browser like walking on a field filled with
bear-traps, as if every form of interaction was tailor made for you to rage-reply.

While this has helped (a little) in reducing my general screen time, it has also led me to wonder if there ever
was a moment in Internet history where people were civil and educated or if, to the contrary, I was just observing
the past with rose-tinted glasses. After all, after serious considerations, it seems that the angriness that
dominates the Internet today has always been there and I was just not on the receiving end of that agglomerated
rage. I've been particularly drawn to consider the latter after reading some articles on the _Wired_
magazine. Whether for better or worse, _Wired_ is at the forefront of Internet innovation, and that regard
encompasses the societal and behavioral changes that trend across the globe. The most recent one? The notion that
the Internet, whose access to is considered an universal right, should be a place where one could feel safe. Me
and other Internet veterans might quickly agree to this, however, as Filthy Frank (now Joji) once put it, the only
way to achieve this was to hate and attack each other without regard to race, religion, sexual orientation and
whatnot. Internet has never been, as far as I can remember, a place where one could wander around without
receiving a couple of hits for any reason being. This was just the nature of an anonymous community.

And maybe that's the thing that has changed. The Internet is no longer full of anonymous users with anime avatars
or, as some user puts it either on Twitter (now X), 4chan or Facebook, the “indigenous peoples of the Internet”;
it is filled now with real people with real names and pictures and real lives, who do not consider the Internet an
alternate reality but rather an extension of their meatspace personas. In a place as such, being hateful or even
inconsiderate is clearly deemed as less than acceptable. That might be the reason why I've become more sensitive
towards Internet's hateful content (there's that word again), because when it is targeted towards me, even though
it is aimed at just another random face in the sea of people from the perspective of the offender, it is directed
towards me, no longer an avatar, in the original sense of the word, but a representation of my real individuality.

So, where should we all go if we want to feel comfortable on the Internet? In my time on it, I've observed many
exoduses, from Facebook, Twitter, even Instagram, all the way down to some sites that only my Latin American
friends will find familiar: Fotolog, Metroflog and Hi5, exoduses that happened for a wide variety of reasons.
However they all shared, just like their analog counterpart, the same core behind them: they were looking for a
new place to call home. Nowadays I have my own personal website ([part of a wider movement that aims to bring the
personal web back](https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php?threads/the-personal-web.5647/)), I run my own Mastodon
instance where I post my photos and occasional thoughts, I have my own Discord server, just recently I came back
to Instagram, because I wanted my pictures to have a wider audience, and scroll trough some web forums and image
boards without really clicking with any of them. I am no longer an Internet citizen, I am an Internet refugee,
or nomad, depending on how proud I am feeling in any particular day. There might no longer be a place which I
could call home, but that doesn't stop me from looking. In the meantime, I occasionally like to log off, grab a
physical book and read it with a hot cup of coffee by the side, the way generations of our ancestors did, and
that before the Internet, the radio and telephone was the only way to feel part of a bigger community. Books
like _House of Leaves_ make me feel like there is room for hypertextuality even among paper books. And who knows,
maybe the next social network will no longer require the use of a computer to log into it.
