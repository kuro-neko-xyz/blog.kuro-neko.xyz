_Less is more_ is probably one of the mantras our modern society wants us to believe in. And sure, it sounds
nice on paper (or screen) but we, filthy capitalists-to-be, are obsessed with quite the contrary: _more is
more_, that is. And, specifically, if it is about consuming we are talking about, then _more-ly_ is the
only way it can be done. This has led us to what I consider to be one of the saddest oxymora I've ever
encountered, talking to people about _their reasons to live_ (conversations can get quite dread-y during the
dead hours of work), music comes up as a champion in what can only be described as a Nietzschean view on the power
of music in making life worth living.

And, yet, music has become so commodified to the point in which we actually perceive it as mundane, trivial, not
worthy of attention. Here's a fun thing to do: next time you are running errands around the city, stop to look at
how many clerks bored-out-of-their-brains have music playing in the background. Music, with all its
rescuing-us-from-the-depths-of-boredom, has become our go-to resource when killing time is what's in the order. We
even take pride on the act of listening to a song so much that we get _used_ to it, as if it were a
background item in our commuting route.

Well I say, _no more_, I'm here to defend music from the codependent relationship we have engaged it with
us. I believe it is time to _consciously_ listen to music. While I'm not trying to deprive us wageslaves from
the only thing that makes our working day bearable (I do also work while listening to music), I'm here to make the
statement that music listening is something we should not take for granted.

Enter the iPod. What's special about such a device. Nothing, at least nothing when we compare it to the plethora
of mp3 players that plagued the late aughts. For the purpose being, any old USB stick with a headphone jack would
do the job. What matters is that it forces us to _think_ about listening to music. As opposed to just opening
an app in our smartphones, the physical act of carrying another device in order to listen to some tunes makes us
stop and wonder: “am I going to listen to music today?”

This rewiring of our brain is the first step in making us appreciate music more. If our mp3 player's capacity is
low enough it can even makes us _think_ about what songs we want to listen. I can say that, since I started
using iPods, my music listening time has gone up. I carry an iPod whenever I know I might be in a situation in
which I would like to listen to some music, just like I carry a camera when I think I might encounter something
worth taking a picture of. Sometimes I even carry nothing but my iPod. There is nothing like the feeling of going
for a walk with a set of cans cranking up your favorite album, knowing well that you are virtually unreachable.

But, in my opinion, the greatest sensation from the whole iPod-carrying business has to be independence from
third parties, knowing that you _own_ your music, that it is a part of you, that no matter which servers in
God-knows-where go down you have it always at your disposal, that you have, indeed, a collection of music whose
albums and singles showcase a part of your personality, that you can show to your friends your taste and compare
it to that of others.

Instead of relying on algorithms to discover new artists, you actually have to interact with people in order to
do so. This way, music listening becomes a more humane thing, as it was always supposed to be. Unlike the
AI-generated DJ mixes that Spotify or whoever pushes through the Wired, you are the DJ, making sick mixtapes with
your favorite songs. You can even go as far as to make a real mixtape, cassette and all, turning 0's and 1's into
a physical thing that you can own or gift to anyone you love.

Let's bring back music. Let's make it again something to enjoy.
